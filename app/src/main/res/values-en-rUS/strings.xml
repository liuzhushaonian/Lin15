    <string name="reset_content">Resetting systemUI means actively deleting the local data of Lin16 in systemUI\n
For example, sharedPreferences for saving various variables and saved background images will be deleted. \n
The purpose of this function is that after the user uninstalls lin16, the sharedPreferences left by lin16 and the set pictures will remain in the systemUI.
If the user does not want this data to remain in the phone\n
you can use this feature to delete the remaining traces. \n
Note that after using this function\n
please uninstall the app and restart your phone. \n
This function has another function\n
which is to clear the old traces\n
reset all settings, then your phone will be restored to the way you have never installed lin16\n
everything starts again, it is strongly recommended to restart the phone after reset\n
